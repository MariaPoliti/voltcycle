# Cyclic voltametry data

* data type : most common ones has prefix of .dta, .mpt and .z.
	Heka can be used in our case for reading in different data types.

* Characteristics of CV data:
	a. Reversibility : This is not the chemical reversibility rather is to describe the rate of electron transfer.
	b. Chemical reversibility : if the oxidation peak can be redused in nagative swep.
	c. Peak potential : The potential at which the current reaches a maximum (or minimum) during an electron transfer event is referred to as the peak potential, or Ep. One can obtain information about such processes such as the rate of electron transfer, ligand binding constants, or the rate determining step of a multistep transformation by measuring how the Ep changes under different conditions. 
	# For this part we need good peak finding tools.
	d. Peak current: The peak current is the (baseline corrected) current at the maximum (or minimum) of a feature in a CV. If the baseline current before the wave is 2 µA, then 2 µA must be subtracted from ip of wave under study. Non-zero baseline currents are to be expected, as it results from the act of changing the electrode potential, but it may also be due to the presence of another wave that occurs at an earlier time in the scan.The change in ip with scan rate can determine whether the electron transfer occurs between the electrode and a species in solution, or a species adsorbed on the electrode surface. The ip can also be used to measure the diffusion coefficient of an analyte with a simple equation that is covered in another section.
	e. Diffusion limited current: The diffusion limited current can be used to find the diffusion coefficient of the analyte. This might be beyond the scoop of our project.
